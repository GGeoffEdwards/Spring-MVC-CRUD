#CRUD Project
This is my C.R.U.D(create, read, update, delete) project from
week 8 at Skill Distillery.  For this project I created a car buying
site.  It reads in a csv file of cars and then a user is able to view
the full list, filter the list by color, make, cost, and if its new or
used, or search by an id.  The user is also able to update car
information, remove a car by id, buy a car they are viewing or add
a new car.  After a car is removed,
updated, or added it writes to the csv file with the new information.
The site is made through sessions so a second viewer would not impact
the first viewers experience.

###Technologies Used

- Java
- JSP/JSTL
- HTML
- CSS
- Tomcat8
- Amazon Web Services
- Eclipse Spring Tool Suite
- Git

###Future Improvements
If I had more time to work on this project I would add log in system
so that people would only be able to update or remove a car that
they added to the list while all users would still be able to purchase
them.  I would also add next and previous buttons so that the user would
be able to navigate through the filtered list or all cars without
having to go back to the filter or view all list.
